Part 3 - Cybersecurity Research
Research major cybersecurity breaches over the past 20 years and pick 
one to write a short essay on.

Give an overview of what the breach was and the motivations behind it.

In 2017 Equifax was breached through an application vulnerability on one of their
websites. This lead to the breach of social security numbers, birthdates, addresses,
and in some cases driver license numbers and credit card information for roughly
148 million people.

Explain where the “tech flaws” were, and how hackers were able to breach their system.

It appears the security team failed to patch a vulnerability in "apache struts" even
after it had been warned and had research conducted. This vulnerability allowed the 
attackers to have access to their network for several months. 

What has the company done to protect against that vulnerability since?

They focused on improving system monitoring, enhancing the security team's communication
with the c-suite, change the corporate culture through getting better employees focused
on cybersecurity.
